A version of the classic arcade game ‘Space Invaders’ programmed in the functional language Racket.

Note: Language not supported on GitHub, so it won’t be possible to view the code here. One would have to download Dr. Racket to view the code and play the game.

To start the game, type (main G0) into the editor’s console. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, press the space bar to fire a missile. You will lose if an invader makes it’s way to the bottom of the screen.
